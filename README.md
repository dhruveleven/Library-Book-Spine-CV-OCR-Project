# üìö Book Locator using OCR and CV on Book Spines  

This project helps **locate books in a library or bookshelf image** by combining **Computer Vision (YOLO)** for book spine detection and **OCR (Tesseract)** for extracting text from detected regions.  
A user can then search for a book title/author, and the system highlights the matching book in the image.

## üîç Workflow  
1. **Dataset & Training**  
   - Book spine detection model trained on a dataset (e.g., via **Roboflow**) using **YOLOv8**.  
   - Model detects bounding boxes of books in a shelf image.  

2. **Detection & OCR**  
   - YOLO detects book spines.  
   - Extracted regions are passed through **PyTesseract** to recognize text (titles/authors).  

3. **Search**  
   - All detected book titles are displayed.  
   - User enters a **title/author to search**.  
   - Fuzzy string matching improves accuracy even if OCR has minor errors.  

4. **Highlight & Save**  
   - Matching book spine is highlighted with a bounding box.  
   - Final image is **saved** with highlighted results.

## üöÄ Vision & Future Scope  
This project is a **prototype** but can scale into a **global book-finding system** for libraries, bookstores, and archives.  

- ‚úÖ **Smart Cameras in Libraries** ‚Äì Real-time book location guidance  
- ‚úÖ **AR Glasses** ‚Äì Overlay arrows highlighting the target book on shelves  
- ‚úÖ **Laser/Projector Systems** ‚Äì Physically point to the right book  
- ‚úÖ **Robotics** ‚Äì Automated retrieval from shelves  
- ‚úÖ **Cloud Deployment** ‚Äì Centralized service accessible via mobile/web apps

## üîÆ Future Improvements  
- Improve OCR accuracy with **deep learning OCR models** (EAST, CRNN)  
- **Multilingual support** (English, Hindi, Spanish, etc.)  
- Handle **partially visible / tilted spines**  
- Auto-update **book catalog** by integrating with library DBs

## Limitations Faced
- Limited computational power for increased accuracy as this project was done on a laptop without GPU.
